<h1> Biography</h1>
<p><span class="bio">contentMy name is Caroline Nowak. I am a junior at Tufts University majoring in Economics and minoring in Computers Science. Originally from Chicago, but as a person who loves to travel and experience new things, I am open to relocating both nationally and internationally.</span></p>

<p><span class="bio">This summer I worked for IBM Watson in Austin, Texas. As a Solutions Business Strategy Intern, I led a cross-functional team of cognitive software engineers, linguists and designers. My responsibilities included developing use cases through primary research and design-thinking methodology, and analyzing demand for big-data text analytics. Our assignment was to create a viable and marketable application for financial risk managers and analysts. The solution we developed met all key performance metrics by: 1) Successfully applying IBM Watson annotators to SEC documents to extract and analyze top threats; 2) Correlate entities at risk of particular threats; 3) Identify trends in these threats and their effects over time on a company, sector, and market level. We delivered a patentable product against tight deadlines.</span></p>

<p><span class="bio">My interest in finance and technology led me to participate in Tufts Financial group as an analyst for the Technology, Media, and Telecommunications Sector. I researched and presented an analysis of PayPal’s growth metrics, sources of revenue, and impact of acquisitions to the club’s executive board. </span></p>

<p><span class="bio">Additionally, I am a midfielder on the Tufts Varsity Lacrosse Team, which has taught me the importance of hard work, teamwork, time management and leadership in all aspects of my life. For the last two years I was selected to serve as a Pre-Orientation leader and member of Tufts’ Fitness and Individual Development program, a student-run orientation program that promotes student fitness and well-being. As a leader, it was my responsibility to organize and plan events as well as mentor 12 freshmen. I enjoy and appreciate serving as a role model for Tufts Athletics and giving back to the Tufts community.</span></p>
